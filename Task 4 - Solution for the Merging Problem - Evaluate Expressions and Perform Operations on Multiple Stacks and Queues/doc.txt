Task 4: Solution for the Merging Problem - Evaluate Expressions and Perform Operations on Multiple Stacks and Queues
This program implements a solution to the merging problem by performing operations on multiple stacks and queues. It includes functionality for:

Evaluating expressions using stacks.
Merging operations on multiple stacks.
Merging operations on multiple queues.

-------------------------------------
code.c 
-------------------------------------

Explanation
Stack Operations:

Implemented push and pop to manipulate the stack.
Stacks can be merged by transferring elements from one stack to another.
Queue Operations:

Implemented enqueue and dequeue to manipulate the queue.
Queues can be merged by transferring elements from one queue to another.
Expression Evaluation:

Used stacks to evaluate postfix expressions (e.g., 23*4+ results in 10).
Performed mathematical operations based on operators (+, -, *, /).
Main Menu:

Provides options to push, pop, merge, and evaluate expressions interactively.

Sample Output
Push, Merge Stacks, and Display:
Menu:
1. Push into Stack 1
2. Push into Stack 2
3. Merge Stacks
4. Enqueue into Queue 1
5. Enqueue into Queue 2
6. Merge Queues
7. Evaluate Postfix Expression
8. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter value to push into Stack 1: 5
Enter your choice: 2
Enter value to push into Stack 2: 10
Enter your choice: 3
Merged Stack: 10 5

---------------------------------------------------
Enqueue, Merge Queues, and Display:

Enter your choice: 4
Enter value to enqueue into Queue 1: 3
Enter your choice: 5
Enter value to enqueue into Queue 2: 7
Enter your choice: 6
Merged Queue: 3 7


---------------------------------------------------
Evaluate Postfix Expression:

Enter your choice: 7
Enter a postfix expression: 23*4+
Result of evaluation: 10
